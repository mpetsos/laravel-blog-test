Design decisions:

For Design decisions, I used Laravel v12 and MySQL. For the design, I used the Bootstrap libraries and created a minimal layout. 
Created a minimal layout with basic elements which, however, can be easily developed/expanded by designers (custom CSS, JS, etc. files).

I took the initiative to create user roles (admin, user) to give the admin the ability to perform certain actions on the blog (e.g., to edit the categories).
Another initiative was to create a form with filters, mostly for my own ease in searching and managing the posts.

In the programming of the API, I used security code and tried to make it as user-friendly as possible for the end-user with the appropriate requests and responses.

Generally, I tried to create secure code and make it as friendly as possible for editing by other developers with simple and fast functions, a friendly schema, and the appropriate comments within the code.



Challenges:

Generally, I did not face serious difficulties since I am familiar with similar applications. 
I would say that I needed more time for the design of the application and less for the implementation.
